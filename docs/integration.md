# Integration details

## Native document format

Schema version 2 contains `text`, semantic `spans`, and top-level `blocks`. Positions are half-open UTF-16 code-unit ranges into rendered text. They match NSRange and Android String/Spannable indexing, including emoji. Table-cell spans also retain row/column indices, header status, and alignment. Math occupies one object-replacement character with PNG bytes, dimensions, and original TeX in its span.

`MarkitDocument.source(...)` restores original TeX when exporting rendered text. Unknown semantic styles can be ignored by a host. Consumers should check `version` before interpreting ranges. Rendering code source directly preserves its exact text, including newlines; Markdown parsing applies CommonMark newline normalization.

The C header specifies buffer ownership and errors. Every non-null result buffer is freed once with `markit_buffer_free`. Streams are opaque handles, owned until `markit_stream_free`, with one caller at a time. Swift serializes stream access. Android uses checked numeric handles backed by a registry, with a maximum of 64 live streams; close streams and views when no longer needed.

## Streaming

`StreamRenderer.append(delta, finalized)` returns `replace_from` and replacement blocks. Retain blocks before that index, remove the previous suffix, then append new blocks. Text before a settled root is not reparsed during ordinary appends. One or two trailing roots stay open until table/list/setext parsing is unambiguous. Display math keeps its region open until its closer arrives. Late reference definitions invalidate earlier output so references resolve correctly.

An unfinished single huge paragraph, list, fence, or formula remains an open root and can require work proportional to that root on each update. Reference-definition updates can require a full parse. Hosts should batch fast token streams to display cadence. The included views and web wrapper retain one queued replacement to avoid unbounded job growth.

Native streams return native documents; the Wasm stream returns HTML only. Public Rust `StreamRenderer::new()` returns both for integrations that need them. `new_native()` and `new_html()` avoid unnecessary output work.

## Host actions

Web `onReference`, UIKit `onReference`, and Android `onReference` receive a reference kind and target. Use the host's existing file, thread, and PR resolution code. Rendering never opens a local file itself. Web links retain normal safe navigation unless intercepted. Native links can be intercepted with `onLink`.

Image resolvers must return bytes the host has already authorized. Web supports PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF Blob data or PNG Uint8Array data. Native callbacks return UIImage/Bitmap objects. The renderer performs no network requests for images. Abort signals and view disposal release pending web loads and Blob URLs.

For a React transcript, create the renderer in an effect, call `render` from a separate text-update effect, and call `destroy` during cleanup. Do not recreate the worker on every token. In SwiftUI use `MarkitText` as a scrolling region. In Android Compose embed MarkitView with AndroidView and close it in the owning disposal callback.

## Limits

Native and Wasm streams accept at most 8 MiB of UTF-8 source. Native one-shot wrappers accept at most 16 MiB including code-request JSON. The default highlighter returns exact plain text for source over 1 MiB or token output over 8,192 runs. Highlight and math caches have separate accounted budgets of 4 MiB and 128 entries per rendering thread; allocator overhead and caller-owned results are outside those budgets. Oversized results are not cached.

Math source is limited to 2,048 bytes, with layout dimensions bounded before bitmap allocation. Unsupported formulas display their original source. Web code fences over 400 lines use a 320 px viewport. Native code/table panes use at most a 320 point/dp viewport and recycle visible rows. Extremely wide native code lines have a bounded horizontal layout width; copying retains the full source.
